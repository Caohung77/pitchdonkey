- ✅ Smooth workflow from segment → campaign

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

1. **No contacts showing**: Check if you're logged in as the right user
2. **Segment creation fails**: Check browser console for errors
3. **Contact counts seem wrong**: The estimation is based on filters and may not be exact
4. **Campaign creation fails**: Make sure you have at least one segment selected

## 🔄 Reset Data (if needed)

To regenerate contacts with different data:
```bash
node populate-contacts.js
```

This will clear existing contacts and create 100 new ones.
