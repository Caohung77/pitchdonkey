# Authentication Fix Requirements

## Introduction

This feature addresses the persistent authentication issues where users are getting signed out and receiving 401 Unauthorized errors when navigating within the dashboard. The system needs to maintain proper user sessions and handle authentication state consistently across all components and API endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Persistent User Session Management

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my session to persist when navigating between dashboard pages so that I don't get unexpectedly signed out.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in successfully THEN the system SHALL maintain their session across all dashboard pages
2. WHEN a user navigates between dashboard pages THEN the system SHALL NOT redirect them to the sign-in page
3. WHEN a user's session is valid THEN all API endpoints SHALL recognize their authentication
4. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN their session SHALL remain active if not expired
5. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect them to sign-in with a clear message

### Requirement 2: Consistent API Authentication

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want all API calls to work properly so that I can access my data without getting unauthorized errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes API requests THEN all endpoints SHALL properly validate their session
2. WHEN an API endpoint receives a request THEN it SHALL use the correct Supabase client for authentication
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the API SHALL return consistent error responses
4. WHEN a user's session is valid THEN dashboard stats, notifications, and health checks SHALL load successfully
5. WHEN API authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3: Robust AuthProvider Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication system to handle errors gracefully so that temporary issues don't break my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AuthProvider initializes THEN it SHALL properly detect existing sessions
2. WHEN user profile API calls fail THEN the AuthProvider SHALL use fallback user data
3. WHEN authentication state changes THEN all components SHALL receive updated user information
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the AuthProvider SHALL retry authentication checks
5. WHEN the user signs out THEN the AuthProvider SHALL clear all session data

### Requirement 4: Dashboard Layout Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to load properly with my user information so that I can see my profile and notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN it SHALL display the correct user information
2. WHEN fetching notifications THEN the system SHALL handle API response formats correctly
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the dashboard SHALL show appropriate fallback content
4. WHEN the user signs out THEN the dashboard SHALL redirect to the sign-in page
5. WHEN authentication is loading THEN the dashboard SHALL show loading states

### Requirement 5: Middleware Authentication Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to properly protect routes so that I can only access pages I'm authorized to see.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing protected routes THEN the middleware SHALL verify valid sessions
2. WHEN sessions are expired THEN the middleware SHALL redirect to sign-in
3. WHEN already authenticated THEN the middleware SHALL allow access to protected routes
4. WHEN accessing auth pages while logged in THEN the middleware SHALL redirect to dashboard
5. WHEN middleware errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when authentication issues occur so that I understand what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages
2. WHEN sessions expire THEN users SHALL be notified before redirect
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL distinguish between auth and other errors
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN users SHALL see appropriate retry options
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL log authentication events properly
