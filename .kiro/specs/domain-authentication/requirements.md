# Domain Authentication Requirements

## Introduction

This feature enables users to set up and verify domain authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) for their email accounts to improve deliverability and establish sender reputation. The system will provide step-by-step tutorials, DNS record generation, and automated verification to help users properly configure their domains for cold email outreach.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: DNS Record Generation and Tutorial System

**User Story:** As a cold email sender, I want clear instructions and generated DNS records so that I can properly configure my domain authentication without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Setup Domain Auth" THEN the system SHALL display a step-by-step tutorial for their specific domain
2. WHEN the system generates DNS records THEN it SHALL provide exact copy-paste values for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
3. WHEN displaying tutorials THEN the system SHALL include provider-specific instructions (GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Namecheap, etc.)
4. WHEN a user selects their DNS provider THEN the system SHALL show customized screenshots and steps for that provider
5. WHEN generating DKIM records THEN the system SHALL create unique public/private key pairs for each domain

### Requirement 2: Automated Domain Verification

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically check if my DNS records are correctly configured so that I know my domain authentication is working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Verify Domain" THEN the system SHALL perform DNS lookups for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
2. WHEN DNS records are found THEN the system SHALL validate their syntax and configuration
3. WHEN verification is complete THEN the system SHALL update the database with verification status
4. WHEN records are missing or incorrect THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and suggestions
5. WHEN verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL display green checkmarks and confirmation messages

### Requirement 3: Domain Authentication Dashboard

**User Story:** As a user, I want a centralized view of all my domain authentication statuses so that I can manage multiple domains efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the domain auth dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all domains with their verification status
2. WHEN displaying domain status THEN the system SHALL show SPF, DKIM, and DMARC status separately
3. WHEN a domain has issues THEN the system SHALL highlight problems with actionable next steps
4. WHEN a user clicks on a domain THEN the system SHALL show detailed DNS record information
5. WHEN records need updates THEN the system SHALL provide new DNS values to copy

### Requirement 4: Integration with Email Account Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want domain authentication to be seamlessly integrated with my email accounts so that I can see which accounts are properly configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing email accounts THEN the system SHALL display domain authentication status for each account
2. WHEN an email account's domain is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL show warning indicators
3. WHEN a user adds a new email account THEN the system SHALL automatically check domain authentication
4. WHEN domain authentication is missing THEN the system SHALL provide quick access to setup tutorials
5. WHEN authentication is complete THEN the system SHALL update email account verification status

### Requirement 5: Educational Content and Best Practices

**User Story:** As a user new to email deliverability, I want educational content about domain authentication so that I understand why it's important and how it affects my campaigns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses domain authentication THEN the system SHALL provide educational content about SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
2. WHEN explaining concepts THEN the system SHALL use simple language and practical examples
3. WHEN showing best practices THEN the system SHALL include deliverability tips and common mistakes
4. WHEN a user completes setup THEN the system SHALL provide next steps for improving sender reputation
5. WHEN displaying help content THEN the system SHALL include links to additional resources

### Requirement 6: DNS Provider Integration and Automation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically configure DNS records when possible so that I can avoid manual DNS management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects their DNS provider API THEN the system SHALL offer automatic DNS record creation
2. WHEN automatic setup is available THEN the system SHALL show one-click configuration options
3. WHEN API integration is not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to manual instructions
4. WHEN using automation THEN the system SHALL verify changes were applied correctly
5. WHEN automation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and manual fallback

### Requirement 7: Monitoring and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a user, I want ongoing monitoring of my domain authentication so that I'm alerted if records become invalid or need updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN domain records are configured THEN the system SHALL periodically re-verify their status
2. WHEN records become invalid THEN the system SHALL send email notifications to the user
3. WHEN DKIM keys need rotation THEN the system SHALL provide new keys and update instructions
4. WHEN displaying monitoring status THEN the system SHALL show last verification time and next check
5. WHEN issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps
