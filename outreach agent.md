🌐 Outreach Agent – Full Concept

🎯 What It Is

A configurable AI sales assistant that users can create, customize, and assign to campaigns.
Each Outreach Agent can:
	1.	Draft replies to incoming prospect emails (auto-reply drafts).
	2.	Generate personalized outbound content (openers, subject lines, follow-ups).
	3.	Manage its own knowledge base (PDFs, text, links, product info).
	4.	Define its own segment rules to automatically select & score the right contacts.

🟨 Runtime Behavior

Inbound (receiving emails)
	1.	Prospect reply comes in via IMAP/Gmail API/Graph API.
	2.	Agent context is built: identity + product info + goals + knowledge + contact info + intent classification.
	3.	Model generates a draft reply (polite, concise, aligned with agent’s goal).
	4.	Draft is shown in UI for approval/edit → send.

Outbound (sending emails)
	1.	Campaign is linked to an Outreach Agent.
	2.	Agent personalizes subject lines & openers with product + knowledge context.
	3.	Send-time optimization optional (AI suggests best hour).
	4.	Variant testing: generates multiple subject/CTA options → tracks performance.

Segment Selection
	1.	Agent runs its segment rules on contact DB.
	2.	Scores each contact (0–100) with reasons.
	3.	Adds top N contacts above threshold into campaign.
	4.	Auto-refresh daily/weekly if scheduled.
	5.	Explainability → user sees why each contact was chosen.

	•	Sales teams: experiment with tone & ICP variations
	•	Auto-segmentation saves manual work and ensures campaigns are always fed with fresh, relevant contacts
	•	Knowledge base ensures AI replies feel on-brand and product-aware, not generic

⚡ Bonus Differentiators
	•	Explainability panel: every selection/reply shows why it was generated.
	•	Multiple active agents: assign different agents to different campaigns.
	•	Embeddings search: knowledge base used to answer prospect-specific questions.
	•	Metrics per agent: reply rate, open rate, bounce rate → compare agents.
