# Quick Start: Avatar Generation with Google Imagen

## ✅ Updated Implementation

I've updated the Imagen generator to use the **correct Google Imagen API** as documented at:
https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/imagen

---

## 🚀 Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your API Key
1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Copy your API key (starts with `AIza...`)

### Step 2: Add to Environment
```bash
# Add to .env.local
echo "GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaYourKeyHere" >> .env.local

# Or use the alternative name
echo "GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=AIzaYourKeyHere" >> .env.local
```

### Step 3: Generate Avatars
```bash
# Generate avatars for your 3 sample personas
npx tsx scripts/generate-sample-avatars.ts
```

## 📸 What You Get

The system will generate professional corporate headshots for:
- **Sarah Chen** (Customer Support) - Female, Asian, 30-40s, empathetic appearance
- **Marcus Rodriguez** (SDR) - Male, Hispanic, 25-32, energetic presence
- **Emma Thompson** (Success Manager) - Female, Caucasian, 32-42, professional look

Each headshot features:
- ✅ Clean white background
- ✅ Professional studio lighting
- ✅ Business casual attire
- ✅ 1:1 aspect ratio (perfect for profile photos)
- ✅ High-resolution photorealistic quality
- ✅ Personality-appropriate expression

```javascript
POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/imagen-3.0-generate-002:generateImages

{
  "prompt": "Professional corporate headshot portrait...",
  "numberOfImages": 1,
  "aspectRatio": "1:1",
  "personGeneration": "allow_adult"
}

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Prompt Building**: Creates detailed prompt with persona-specific attributes
   ```
   Professional corporate headshot portrait, 33-45 years old professional,
   female presenting, Asian ethnicity, warm, approachable, friendly demeanor,
   wearing business casual blazer or professional shirt,
   confident smile, approachable expression, clean white background,
   professional studio portrait lighting, 24-35mm portrait lens perspective...
   ```

2. **API Call**: Sends request to Google Imagen with optimal parameters

3. **Image Handling**: Receives base64 encoded image data

4. **Storage**: Returns data URL (can be uploaded to Supabase later)

5. **Database Update**: Updates persona record with avatar URL

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: API key not configured
```bash
# Make sure .env.local exists and has the key
cat .env.local | grep GOOGLE

# Restart dev server after adding key
npm run dev
```

### Error: Rate limited
```bash
# The script includes 2-second delays between requests
# If you still get rate limited, increase the delay in:
# scripts/generate-sample-avatars.ts (line: setTimeout)
```

### Error: Safety filter triggered
```bash
# Rare case where prompt triggers safety filter
# The script will mark as 'failed' and you can retry
# Prompts are carefully crafted to avoid this
```

### Images not showing in UI
```bash
# Base64 data URLs should work immediately
# If not, check browser console for errors
# May need to implement Supabase Storage upload for persistence
```

## 💰 Cost

**Google Imagen API Pricing** (as of documentation):
- Free tier available for testing
- Pay-as-you-go after free tier
- Each image generation counts as 1 request

**For 3 sample personas**: ~$0.06 (estimated)

## 🔄 Regenerate Avatars
