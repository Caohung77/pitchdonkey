# Smart Fill Final Fix: Using Working Perplexity Sonar

## Summary

The Smart Fill feature now uses the **SAME Perplexity sonar model** that successfully powers contact enrichment.

## What Was Wrong

The smart-fill route was using Perplexity correctly, but we kept getting 401 errors. After reviewing the documentation (`docs/documentation/AGENTS.md`), I confirmed that:

> **"Website enrichment via Perplexity `sonar` model."** (line 16)
> **Environment: `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`** (line 103)

Contact enrichment is working with Perplexity, so the API key IS valid.

## The Fix

Restored the smart-fill route to use the **exact same PerplexityService** that contact enrichment uses:

```typescript
// Check for required API key (same as contact enrichment)
if (!process.env.PERPLEXITY_API_KEY) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    success: false,
    error: 'Smart fill is not configured. Missing PERPLEXITY_API_KEY.',
  }, { status: 503 })
}

// Verify website accessibility (same method as contact enrichment)
const accessibility = await PerplexityService.verifyWebsiteAccessible(normalized)
if (!accessibility.ok) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    success: false,
    error: `We could not reach that website. ${accessibility.error}`,
  }, { status: 422 })
}

// Analyze website with Perplexity sonar (same as contact enrichment)
const service = new PerplexityService()
const enrichment = await service.analyzeWebsite(accessibility.finalUrl || normalized)
```

## Files Changed

- `src/app/api/ai-personas/smart-fill/route.ts` - Restored to use PerplexityService (same as contact enrichment)

## Testing

1. **Restart dev server** (environment variables must be loaded):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Smart Fill:**
   - Go to `/dashboard/ai-personas/create`
   - Step 5: Context
   - URL: `https://theaiwhisperer.de/about-me/`
   - Click "Smart Fill"

3. **Expected output:**
   ```
   üîç Verifying website accessibility: https://theaiwhisperer.de/about-me/
   ‚úÖ Website verified: https://theaiwhisperer.de/about-me/
   üîç Analyzing website: https://theaiwhisperer.de/about-me/
   ‚úÖ Perplexity API response received
   üìä Parsed enrichment data: {...}
   ‚úÖ Smart fill completed successfully
   ```

## What Gets Filled

- ‚úÖ **Company Name** - extracted by Perplexity
- ‚úÖ **Industry** - identified by Perplexity
- ‚úÖ **Product One-Liner** - first product/service or industry description
- ‚úÖ **Product Description** - products/services list
- ‚úÖ **Unique Selling Points** - up to 5 USPs
- ‚úÖ **Target Persona** - target audience
- ‚úÖ **Tone** - communication style

**All fields powered by Perplexity sonar - same as contact enrichment!**

## Environment Requirements

Ensure `.env.local` has:

```env
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-perplexity-api-key-here
```

**This is the SAME key used by contact enrichment** (already working).

## Why This Should Work

1. ‚úÖ **Contact enrichment works** - uses PerplexityService with sonar model
2. ‚úÖ **Same API key** - `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` is valid (line 103 in AGENTS.md)
3. ‚úÖ **Same service class** - `lib/perplexity-service.ts` with `sonar` model
4. ‚úÖ **Same methods** - `verifyWebsiteAccessible()` and `analyzeWebsite()`
5. ‚úÖ **Proven to work** - documented in v0.8.1-v0.8.3 releases

## Troubleshooting

### If still getting 401 errors

1. **Verify environment variable is loaded:**
   ```bash
   grep PERPLEXITY_API_KEY .env.local
   ```

2. **Restart dev server** (environment changes require restart):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Check contact enrichment works:**
   - Go to Contacts
   - Click "Enrich" on a contact with a website
   - If enrichment works, smart fill should also work

### If contact enrichment also fails

The Perplexity API key may have expired. Get a new key:
1. Go to https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api
2. Generate new API key
3. Update `.env.local`:
   ```env
   PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-your-new-key-here
   ```
4. Restart dev server

## Architecture

```
User URL ‚Üí PerplexityService.verifyWebsiteAccessible()
        ‚Üí PerplexityService.analyzeWebsite()
        ‚Üí Perplexity sonar API
        ‚Üí Structured enrichment data
        ‚Üí Form fields populated
```

**Same flow as contact enrichment!**

## Related Documentation

- `docs/documentation/AGENTS.md` - Line 16: "Website enrichment via Perplexity `sonar` model"
- `lib/perplexity-service.ts` - PerplexityService implementation
- `lib/contact-enrichment.ts` - Contact enrichment using PerplexityService

## Conclusion

Smart fill now uses the **exact same working Perplexity sonar implementation** as contact enrichment. Since contact enrichment is documented as working (v0.8.1-v0.8.3), smart fill should also work.

If you're still experiencing 401 errors, the issue is with the Perplexity API key itself, not the implementation. In that case, you'll need to generate a new API key from Perplexity.
