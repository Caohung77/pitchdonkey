  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```

### 6. Database Verification
```sql
-- Check reply jobs were created
SELECT id, status, draft_subject, scheduled_at, risk_score, sent_at
FROM reply_jobs
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check agent assignment
SELECT id, email, assigned_agent_id
FROM email_accounts
WHERE assigned_agent_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Check email sends tracking
SELECT id, status, sent_at, message_id
FROM email_sends
WHERE metadata->>'autonomous' = 'true'
ORDER BY sent_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üß™ End-to-End Test Flow

### Complete Test Sequence
1. ‚úÖ **Setup**: Assign agent to email account
2. ‚úÖ **Draft**: Create draft via API or incoming email
3. ‚úÖ **Review**: View in dashboard, verify all data displays correctly
4. ‚úÖ **Edit**: Test editing subject/body
5. ‚úÖ **Approve**: Approve if high-risk
6. ‚úÖ **Process**: Manually trigger cron job
7. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Check status changed to "sent" and email was sent
8. ‚úÖ **Track**: Verify email_sends record created

## üêõ Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: ‚úÖ FIXED - `date-fns` not installed
**Solution**: Ran `npm install date-fns`

### Issue 2: ‚úÖ FIXED - `sonner` not installed
**Solution**: Ran `npm install sonner` and added `<Toaster />` to root layout

### Issue 3: ‚úÖ FIXED - Next.js route slug naming error
**Solution**: Renamed `[id]` to `[agentId]` for consistency

## üìä Production Readiness

### Required Before Production
- [ ] Set `CRON_SECRET` environment variable in production
- [ ] Configure Ubuntu cron or GitHub Actions for cron job
- [ ] Test email sending with real Gmail OAuth tokens
- [ ] Verify RLS policies work correctly
- [ ] Set up monitoring for reply job failures
- [ ] Configure error alerting

### Recommended Before Production
- [ ] Add rate limiting to draft-reply endpoint
- [ ] Implement email tracking webhooks (opens, clicks)
- [ ] Add user notification system for high-risk replies
- [ ] Create admin dashboard for monitoring
- [ ] Set up backup cron job monitoring

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Ubuntu Cron (Recommended for Free Tier)
```bash
# Add to crontab
*/5 * * * * curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/cron/process-reply-jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```

### Option 2: GitHub Actions
```yaml
name: Process Reply Jobs
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/5 * * * *'  # Every 5 minutes
jobs:
  process-replies:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger Cron
        run: |
          curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/cron/process-reply-jobs \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.CRON_SECRET }}"
```

### Option 3: Vercel Cron (Paid Plan Required)
```json
// vercel.json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/cron/process-reply-jobs",
    "schedule": "*/5 * * * *"
  }]
}
```
