# How to Verify PDF Extraction Success

**Quick Guide:** 5 Ways to Confirm PDF Content Was Extracted and Saved

---

## ✅ 1. Watch Toast Notifications (Easiest)

During persona creation, you'll see these toast messages in order:

```
1️⃣ "Adding 1 knowledge items..."
2️⃣ "Uploading [your-filename].pdf..."
3️⃣ "Extracting content from [your-filename].pdf..."
4️⃣ "1 knowledge item added successfully"
5️⃣ "AI Persona created successfully!"
```

**If you see all 5 messages** → ✅ Extraction successful!

**Alternative message (if adding knowledge after creation):**
```
"PDF content extracted successfully! (XXX words)"
```
This shows how many words were extracted.

---

## 📄 2. Check Persona Detail Page (Visual Confirmation)

### Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3007/dashboard/ai-personas
```

1. **Find your persona** in the list
2. **Click on it** to open detail page
3. **Click "Knowledge Base" tab**
4. **Look for your PDF** in the knowledge items list

### What You'll See:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📎  Your PDF Title                     │
│      Description (if you added one)     │
│                                   ready │
│  [Delete]                               │
│                                         │
│  Content preview appears here...        │
│  (First 3 lines of extracted text)     │
│                                         │
│  🔗 URL: https://...temp-pdf...         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Indicators:**
- ✅ **Title** matches your PDF filename (or custom title)
- ✅ **Status badge** shows "ready" (green)
- ✅ **Content preview** shows extracted text
- ✅ **URL** present (even though temp PDF is deleted, URL is recorded)

**If you DON'T see your PDF:**
- ❌ Extraction might have failed
- Check server console logs for errors

## 🗂️ 3. Verify in Supabase Dashboard (Database Check)

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR-PROJECT-ID
   ```

2. **Navigate to Table Editor → `ai_persona_knowledge`**

3. **Look for your entry** (most recent row)

4. **Check these columns:**

| Column | Expected Value | What It Means |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| `type` | `pdf` | Correct knowledge type |
| `title` | Your PDF title | Matches what you entered |
| `content` | Long text (1000+ chars) | Extracted PDF content |
| `url` | `https://...temp-pdf-uploads/...` | Original upload URL |
| `embedding_status` | `ready` | Content ready to use |
| `created_at` | Recent timestamp | Just created |

### SQL Query to Check:

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  persona_id,
  type,
  title,
  LENGTH(content) as content_length,
  embedding_status,
  created_at,
  url
FROM ai_persona_knowledge
WHERE type = 'pdf'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
type: pdf
title: "Your PDF Title"
content_length: 15234 (example - should be >1000)
embedding_status: ready
created_at: 2025-10-13 12:34:56
url: https://xxx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/temp-pdf-uploads/...
```

---

## 🗑️ 4. Confirm Temp PDF Was Deleted (Cleanup Verification)

### Check Temporary Storage:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage → `temp-pdf-uploads`**

2. **Expected Result:** Bucket should be **EMPTY** ✅

**Why?**
- PDF is uploaded temporarily for Jina AI to access
- After content extraction, PDF is automatically deleted
- Only the extracted text content remains in database

### If You See Files in temp-pdf-uploads:

❌ **Files present** = Cleanup might have failed

**Troubleshooting:**
1. Check server logs for cleanup errors:
   ```
   Failed to delete temp PDF: [error details]
   ```

2. Manually delete via Supabase dashboard:
   - Storage → temp-pdf-uploads → Select file → Delete

3. If cleanup consistently fails, check RLS policies:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies
   WHERE tablename = 'objects'
   AND schemaname = 'storage';
   ```

---

## 🔍 5. Check Server Console Logs (Developer Verification)

### During PDF Upload:

Look for these log messages in your terminal:

```bash
# Successful upload
✅ Temp PDF uploaded: 1728834567890_abc123_document.pdf

# Successful extraction
✅ Extraction successful: 1,234 words

# Successful cleanup
✅ Temp PDF deleted: 1728834567890_abc123_document.pdf
```

### Error Indicators:

```bash
# Upload failed
❌ Supabase storage upload error: [details]

# Extraction failed
❌ Failed to extract content: [Jina AI error]

# Cleanup failed
❌ Failed to delete temp PDF: [permission error]
```

   Product documentation manual

   This guide covers all aspects of our product
   including installation, configuration, and...

   🔗 https://xxx.supabase.co/.../temp-pdf-uploads/...pdf
```

## ❌ Troubleshooting: What If It Fails?

### Issue: No toast messages appear

**Cause:** JavaScript error in browser
**Fix:** Open browser console (F12) and check for errors

### Issue: "Failed to upload PDF" message

**Cause:** Temp storage bucket doesn't exist
**Fix:** Apply migration (see `docs/PDF_UPLOAD_FIX_SUMMARY.md`)

### Issue: "Failed to extract content" message

**Cause:** Jina API error or invalid PDF
**Fix:**
- Check `JINA_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Try a different PDF file
- Check PDF is not password-protected

### Issue: PDF shows in detail page but status is "failed"

**Cause:** Extraction succeeded but embedding failed
**Fix:** This is OK - content is still saved and usable

### Issue: Temp PDF not deleted (files remain in bucket)

**Cause:** Cleanup permission error
**Fix:**
- Check service role has DELETE permission
- Manually delete from Supabase dashboard
- Review RLS policies in migration

## 🔧 Manual Database Check (Advanced)

### Query to See All PDF Knowledge:

```sql
-- Full details of all PDF knowledge items
SELECT
  p.name as persona_name,
  k.title,
  k.description,
  LENGTH(k.content) as content_length,
  k.embedding_status,
  k.created_at,
  k.embedding_metadata
FROM ai_persona_knowledge k
JOIN ai_personas p ON p.id = k.persona_id
WHERE k.type = 'pdf'
ORDER BY k.created_at DESC;
```

### Check Extraction Metadata:

```sql
-- See word count and extraction details
SELECT
  title,
  embedding_metadata->>'wordCount' as word_count,
  embedding_metadata->>'extractedAt' as extracted_at,
  embedding_metadata
FROM ai_persona_knowledge
WHERE type = 'pdf'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected metadata:**
```json
{
  "wordCount": 1234,
  "extractedAt": "2025-10-13T12:45:23.456Z",
  "characterCount": 15234,
  "source": "jina-ai"
}
```
