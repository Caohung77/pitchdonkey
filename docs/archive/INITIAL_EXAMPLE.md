# Example Feature Request: Advanced Email A/B Testing System

## FEATURE:
Build an advanced A/B testing system for email campaigns that allows users to test multiple variables simultaneously (subject lines, content variations, send times, and sender names). The system should automatically determine statistical significance, select winners, and integrate with the existing campaign execution engine. Include a comprehensive analytics dashboard showing test results, confidence intervals, and performance metrics.

**Core Requirements:**
- Support multivariate testing (subject + content + send time combinations)
- Automatic statistical significance calculation with configurable confidence levels
- Winner selection based on multiple metrics (open rate, click rate, reply rate)
- Integration with existing campaign execution engine
- Real-time test results dashboard with detailed analytics
- Test scheduling and automatic winner deployment
- Historical test results and learnings database

## EXAMPLES:
**Reference these existing patterns:**
- `examples/api-routes/campaign-api.ts` - API route structure for campaign management
- `examples/business-logic/email-campaign-service.ts` - Service layer patterns for campaign operations
- `lib/campaigns.ts` - Existing A/B test configuration structure (ab_test_settings)
- `lib/campaign-execution.ts` - Campaign job processing and email sending logic
- `lib/analytics.ts` - Analytics calculation patterns (if exists)
- `components/campaigns/ABTestSetup.tsx` - Existing A/B test UI component
- `components/analytics/PerformanceChart.tsx` - Chart component patterns

**Database patterns to follow:**
- `lib/database-schema.sql` - Table structure and relationships
- Follow existing UUID primary key pattern
- Use JSONB fields for flexible test configuration
- Implement proper foreign key relationships

## DOCUMENTATION:
**Statistical Analysis:**
- [Statistical Significance in A/B Testing](https://blog.analytics-toolkit.com/2017/statistical-significance-ab-testing/) - Understanding confidence intervals
- [Chi-Square Test Implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test) - For significance testing
- [Bayesian A/B Testing](https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html) - Advanced statistical approaches

**Email Marketing Best Practices:**
- [Email A/B Testing Guide](https://mailchimp.com/resources/ab-testing-email-campaigns/) - Industry best practices
- [Subject Line Testing](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-b-test-email-subject-lines) - Subject line optimization

**Technical Implementation:**
- [Supabase Real-time](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime) - For live test results
- [Chart.js Documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/) - For analytics visualization
- [Statistical JavaScript Libraries](https://simple-statistics.readthedocs.io/) - For significance calculations

**Campaign Integration:**
- Review existing campaign execution patterns in `lib/campaign-execution.ts`
- Study email job scheduling and processing logic
- Understand contact progression through campaign steps

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

**PitchDonkey-Specific Requirements:**
- **Plan Limitations**: Advanced A/B testing should be Professional/Agency feature only
- **Email Provider Integration**: Test variants must work with Gmail OAuth, Outlook OAuth, and SMTP
- **Campaign Execution**: Integrate with existing CampaignExecutionEngine without breaking current functionality
- **Database Schema**: Extend existing ab_test_settings JSONB field or create new tables for complex tests
- **Real-time Updates**: Use Supabase subscriptions for live test result updates
- **Contact Management**: Ensure test variants don't violate contact preferences or unsubscribe status

**Statistical Considerations:**
- **Minimum Sample Size**: Implement minimum sample size requirements before declaring winners
- **Test Duration**: Enforce minimum test duration to account for different user behaviors
- **Confidence Levels**: Support 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals
- **Multiple Testing**: Implement Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
- **Early Stopping**: Implement early stopping rules for tests that show clear winners

**Technical Implementation Gotchas:**
- **Database Transactions**: Use proper transactions when creating test variants and scheduling emails
- **Error Handling**: Handle edge cases like identical performance between variants
- **Performance**: Optimize analytics queries for large datasets with proper indexes
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed test results
- **Email Delivery**: Account for delivery delays when calculating test timing

**User Experience Considerations:**
- **Test Setup Wizard**: Create intuitive UI for setting up complex multivariate tests
- **Results Visualization**: Clear, understandable charts for non-technical users
- **Winner Notification**: Alert users when tests reach significance and winners are determined
- **Test History**: Comprehensive history of past tests for learning and reference

**Integration Points:**
- **Campaign Builder**: Integrate A/B test setup into campaign creation workflow
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Show test results alongside campaign performance metrics
- **Contact Segmentation**: Ensure test groups don't overlap inappropriately
- **Email Templates**: Allow testing of different email templates and content variations
- **Send Time Optimization**: Integrate with timezone detection for send time testing

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Don't test too many variables simultaneously (statistical power issues)
- Don't stop tests too early (false positives)
- Don't ignore practical significance vs statistical significance
- Don't test during holidays or unusual periods
- Don't reuse the same contacts for multiple overlapping tests
- Don't forget to account for email provider deliverability differences

**Success Metrics:**
- Users can create and launch multivariate A/B tests
- Statistical significance is calculated accurately
- Winners are automatically selected and deployed
- Test results are clearly visualized in dashboard
- System integrates seamlessly with existing campaign execution
- Performance impact is minimal on existing campaign functionality
